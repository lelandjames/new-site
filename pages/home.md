        <h1>ENWORLD</h1>
        <p><em>An Encapsulated Future</em></p>
        <h2>A NOVEL</h2>
        <p><b>A World Ruled by Algorithms and Ambition</b></p>
        <p>A searing satire and a rallying cry, EnWorld exposes the seductive dangers of totalitarianism in the modern age and the fragile line between good and evil. For fans of Orwell, Huxley, and Bradbury, <em>EnWorld</em> pushes further into a future that mankind must avoid. As Orwell said, "Don't let it happen."</p>
        <h3>Reviews</h3>
        <p>"A blend of speculative fiction, satire, and thought experiment, explores themes of identity and morality... James’ literary loop-the-loops result in a fun, brainy read. Entertaining and inventive storytelling."</p>
        <p><strong>–Kirkus Reviews</strong></p>
        <p>“EnWorld is a richly philosophical dystopian novel imagining a future where technological progress and totalitarian domination merge to remake human civilization.”</p>
        <p><strong>–Readers Favorite Review, 5-Stars</strong></p>
        <p>“This is a polished, satirical examination of what evil truly means in our modern world. Sharp, witty satire sifting fiction, reality, and contemporary life."</p>
        <p><strong>–PW's Booklife</strong></p>
